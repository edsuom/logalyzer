########## READ THESE IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE APPLYING THIS BLOCKLIST ##########
# All of the CIDRs in this list are here because they host un-secured exploited servers, or client websites.
# Some of these servers/websites are used for spamming, while others attempt hostile script redirects or scraping.
# This list of IP CIDRs should go into a file named "deny_hosts.rules" which is managed by your APF directives.

### Be careful! Your own web host's, or dedicated server's IP may be included in this list.
# If so, you and your users will be totally blocked from HTTP, FTP and Email access!
# If your server's IP is covered by a CIDR in this list, remove it before installing this blocklist!

# If you host multiple web pages and they communicate with each other using http scripts (like "wget"),
# the communication will break if either is listed on this blocklist. The workaround is to add
# "allow from" directives to each server's blocklist, for the other's specific IP address(es).

# You can also direct an APF firewall to allow your own IP addresses, via an included file, named "allow_hosts.rules"
## The .htaccess version of this blocklist is safer to use, as it doesn't normally lock out access to your mail or ftp servers.
